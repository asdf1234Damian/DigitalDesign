@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\asdf1\documents\digitaldesign\practica5dsd\osch.vhd":61:2:61:3|Found inferred clock contadorBCD|clk_0_inferred_clock which controls 26 sequential elements including clk_low. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
