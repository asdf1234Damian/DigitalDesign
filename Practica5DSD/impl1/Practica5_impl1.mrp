  OSC Nominal Frequency (MHz):                      2.08

ASIC Components
---------------

Instance Name: OSCInst0
         Type: OSCH

GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'reset_c' of the design has been inferred as Global
        Set Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR control is 'reset_c'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
