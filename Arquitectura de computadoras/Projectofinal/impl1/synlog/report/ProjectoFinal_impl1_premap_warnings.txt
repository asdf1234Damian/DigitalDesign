@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT531 :"c:\users\asdf1\documents\digitaldesign\arquitectura de computadoras\projectofinal\alu10bits.vhd":25:1:25:2|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 17 sequential elements including aluIns.arithres[16].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\asdf1\documents\digitaldesign\arquitectura de computadoras\projectofinal\divfreq.vhd":18:2:18:3|Found inferred clock testBench|sigOSC_inferred_clock which controls 71 sequential elements including divCU.count[16:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
