---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'Start_c' of the design has been inferred as Global
        Set Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR control is 'Start_c'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
        

     Components on inferred reset domain with GSR Property disabled
--------------------------------------------------------------

     These components have the GSR property set to DISABLED and are on the
     inferred reset domain. The components will respond to the reset signal
     'Start_c' via the local reset on the component and not the GSR component.

     Type and number of components of the type: 
   Register = 5 
   SP8KC = 1

     Type and instance name of component: 
   Register : lcd/state[0]

   Register : lcd/state[2]
   Register : lcd/state[3]
