@W: MT529 :"c:\users\asdf1\documents\digitaldesign\practica3dsd\ejercico3.vhd":17:2:17:3|Found inferred clock SISO|clk which controls 8 sequential elements including Dn[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
