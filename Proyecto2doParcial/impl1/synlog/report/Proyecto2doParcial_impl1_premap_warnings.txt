@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT531 :"c:\users\asdf1\documents\digitaldesign\proyecto2doparcial\proyecto2doparcial.vhd":104:1:104:2|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 27 sequential elements including cociente[0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\asdf1\documents\digitaldesign\proyecto2doparcial\proyecto2doparcial.vhd":54:2:54:3|Found inferred clock ALU|clk_0_inferred_clock which controls 8 sequential elements including m[0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
